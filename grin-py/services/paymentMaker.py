# Checks blocks found by the pool to see if they are ready to be unlocked and made available for payout.

#paymentMaker.py gets unlocked blocks from the pool_blocks table,
#    For each unlocked pool_block:
#        gets worker shares for the past X blocks,
#        Caclulate this workers share of the rewards
#        Add to the pool_utxo
